I’d like your help creating a single SQL table for my small business. Please see the details below:

1 Business Scenario
I run a coffee kiosk that sells drinks and pastries. We don’t have a big POS system — I just need a simple way to record each sale in a single database table. Every purchase should be logged with enough details to track revenue, products sold, and payment methods.

2 Description (Owner’s Perspective)
As the kiosk owner, I want to see:

What items are selling (e.g., cappuccinos vs croissants).

How much money we made each day.

How much came in from cash vs card payments.

The ability to reverse/refund a sale if needed.

I don’t want complicated systems with multiple tables. Just one table that holds all sales records.

3 Reports Needed
Please make sure the table can support these reports:

Daily revenue: How much money did we make today?

Top products: What are the top 5 products by sales volume or revenue in the last month?

Payment reconciliation: How much came in by cash vs card each day?

4 Clarifying Questions (and My Answers)

Q: Should each product sold be its own row, or should we group them into a basket?  
A: Each product type should be its own row. If someone buys 2 cappuccinos and 1 croissant, that’s two rows.

Q: How should refunds be handled?  
A: Insert a reversal row with the same product and price, but a negative quantity and total. Don’t delete old rows.

Q: Do we need to track customers?  
A: No, just products and payments.

Q: Do we need discounts?  
A: Yes, but keep it simple. If a discount applies, bake it into the unit price.

Q: Should we track taxes separately?  
A: No, prices are stored as final “tax included” amounts.
